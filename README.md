**Abstract**

Batch jobs continue to dominate today's high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. As a result, to achieve high system efficiency, proper batch job scheduling is critical. Currently existing HPCs use heuristic priority-based functions to prioritize and schedule jobs. However, once created and deployed by experts, such functions are unable to respond to changes in job loads,optimization targets, or system parameters, potentially resulting in system inefficiency. However, the complex HPC systems
nowadays which are combined with varied loads make the manual process difficult, time-consuming, and prone to human error. This approach is to use the DDPG algorithm, an automated HPC batch work scheduler based on reinforcement learning is presented to address the fundamental issue. This scheduler approach has used multiple knowledge from different sources, yet it can try to learn quality scheduling policies through trial and error methods. To optimize and stabilize the learning process, we have
used a neural network based DDPG algorithm and Multi-arm bandits. It can try to learn quality scheduling strategies for varied workloads and optimization goals with a bit less computation cost, according to thorough testing. Furthermore, I tried to demonstrate that the learned models perform consistently even when applied to unknown workloads, making them suitable for usage in production.
